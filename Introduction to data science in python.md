Q:
# Fix the import of numpy to run without errors
import NumPy as np

A:
import numpy as np

What did you need to change to make the import run without errors?
Possible Answers

Whitespace matters in Python, so spaces must be removed
Python is case-sensitive, so numpy must be all lowercase - CORRECT ANSWER
Python is case-sensitive, so IMPORT must be all uppercase

- [ ] Creating variables

Ex00:

Q:
Define a variable called bayes_age and set it equal to 4.0.
Display the variable bayes_age.

A:
# Fill in Bayes' age (4.0)
bayes_age = 4.0

# Display the variable bayes_age
print(bayes_age)

Ex01:

Q:
Define a variable called favorite_toy whose value is "Mr. Squeaky".
Define a variable called owner whose value is 'DataCamp'.
Show the values assigned to these variables.

A:
# Bayes' favorite toy
favorite_toy = "Mr. Squeaky"

# Bayes' owner
owner = 'DataCamp'

# Display variables
print(favorite_toy)
print(owner)

Ex02:

Q:
Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without producing syntax
errors.

A:
# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors
birthday = "2017-07-14"
case_id = 'DATACAMP!123-456?'

Which of the following is not a valid variable name?

my_dog_bayes
BAYES42
3dogs - CORRECT ANSWER
this_is_a_very_long_variable_name_42

- [ ] Fun with functions

Ex00:

Q:
Use pd.read_csv to load data from a CSV file called ransom.csv. This file
represents the frequency of each letter in the ransom note for Bayes.

A:
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load the 'ransom.csv' into a DataFrame
r = pd.read_csv('ransom.csv')

# Display DataFrame
print(r)

Ex01:

Q:
Correct the code so that it runs without syntax errors

A:
# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors

# Plot a graph
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)

# Display the graph
plt.show()

Ex02:

Q:
Create a variable called plate that represents the observed license plate:
the first three letters were FRQ, but the witness couldn't see the final 4
letters. Use asterisks (*) to represent missing letters.

A:
# Define plate to represent a plate beginning with FRQ
# Use * to represent the missing four letters
plate = 'FRQ****'

Ex03:

Q:
Call lookup_plate() using the variable plate.

A:
# Call the function lookup_plate()
lookup_plate(plate)

Ex04:

Q:
Calling lookup_plate() with the license plate FRQ**** produced too many results.
Luckily, lookup_plate() also accepts a keyword argument: color. Use the color of
the car ('Green') to get a smaller list.

A:
# Call lookup_plate() with the keyword argument for color
lookup_plate(plate, color='Green')

- [ ] What is pandas?

Ex00:

Q:
Import the pandas module under the alias pd.
Load the CSV "credit_records.csv" into a DataFrame called credit_records.
Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method.

A:
# Import pandas under the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV "credit_records.csv"
credit_records = pd.read_csv('credit_records.csv')

# Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method
print(credit_records.head())

Ex01:

Q:
Use the .info() method to inspect the DataFrame credit_records

A:
# Use .info() to inspect the DataFrame credit_records
print(credit_records.info())

How many rows are in credit_records?

103
104 - CORRECT
5
64

- [ ] Selecting columns

Ex00:

Q:
Select the column item from credit_records using brackets and string notation.
Select the column item from credit_records using dot notation.

A:
# Select the column item from credit_records
# Use brackets and string notation
items = credit_records['item']
items = credit_records.item

# Display the results
print(items)

Ex01:

Q:
Correct the code so that it runs without errors.

A:
# One or more lines of code contain errors.
# Fix the errors so that the code runs.

# Select the location column in credit_records
location = credit_records['location']

# Select the item column in credit_records
items = credit_records.item

# Display results
print(location)

Ex02:

Q:
Inspect the DataFrame mpr using info()

A:
# Use info() to inspect mpr
print(mpr.info())

Q:
Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without errors.

A:
# The following code contains one or more errors
# Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without errors

# Select column "Dog Name" from mpr
name = mpr['Dog Name']

# Select column "Missing?" from mpr
is_missing = mpr['Missing?']

# Display the columns
print(name)
print(is_missing)

Q:
Why did this code generate an error?

name = mpr.Dog Name

A:
We need to remove the space in Dog Name.
If a column name has capital letters, then it needs to be in brackets and
string notation. - WRONG. Capital letters can use this type of notation
If a column name contains a space, then it needs to be in brackets and string
notation. - CORRECT

- [ ] Selecting rows with logic

Ex00:

Q:
The variable height_inches represents the height of a suspect. Is height_inches
greater than 70 inches?
The variable plate1 represents a license plate number of a suspect. Is it equal
to FRQ123?
The variable fur_color represents the color of Bayes' fur. Check that fur_color
is not equal to "brown".

A:
# Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?
print(height_inches > 70)
# Is plate1 equal to "FRQ123"?
print(plate1 == "FRQ123")
# Is fur_color not equal to "brown"?
print(fur_color != "brown")

Ex01:

A:
Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2.
Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing.
Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle.

Q:
# Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2
greater_than_2 = mpr[mpr.Age > 2]
print(greater_than_2)

# Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing
still_missing = mpr[mpr.Status == 'Still Missing']
print(still_missing)

# Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle
not_poodle = mpr[mpr['Dog Breed'] != 'Poodle']
print(not_poodle)

Ex02:

Q:
Select rows of credit_records such that the column location is equal to 'Pet
Paradise'.

A:
# Select purchases from 'Pet Paradise'
purchase = credit_records[credit_records.location == 'Pet Paradise']

# Display
print(purchase)

Q:
Which suspects purchased pet supplies before the kidnapping?

A:
Fred Frequentist and Ronald Aylmer Fisher
Gertrude Cox and Kirstine Smith
Fred Frequentist and Gertrude Cox - CORRECT
Ronald Aylmer Fisher and Kirstine Smith
