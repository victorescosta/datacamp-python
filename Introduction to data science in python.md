Q:

# Fix the import of numpy to run without errors
import NumPy as np


A:

import numpy as np

What did you need to change to make the import run without errors?

Whitespace matters in Python, so spaces must be removed

Python is case-sensitive, so numpy must be all lowercase - CORRECT ANSWER

Python is case-sensitive, so IMPORT must be all uppercase

- [ ] Creating variables

Ex00:


Q:

Define a variable called bayes_age and set it equal to 4.0.

Display the variable bayes_age.


A:

# Fill in Bayes' age (4.0)
bayes_age = 4.0


# Display the variable bayes_age

print(bayes_age)

Ex01:

Q:

Define a variable called favorite_toy whose value is "Mr. Squeaky".

Define a variable called owner whose value is 'DataCamp'.

Show the values assigned to these variables.


A:

# Bayes' favorite toy
favorite_toy = "Mr. Squeaky"


# Bayes' owner
owner = 'DataCamp'


# Display variables
print(favorite_toy)
print(owner)

Ex02:

Q:

Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without producing syntax
errors.


A:

# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors
birthday = "2017-07-14"
case_id = 'DATACAMP!123-456?'


Which of the following is not a valid variable name?

my_dog_bayes

BAYES42

3dogs - CORRECT ANSWER

this_is_a_very_long_variable_name_42

- [ ] Fun with functions

Ex00:


Q:

Use pd.read_csv to load data from a CSV file called ransom.csv. This file
represents the frequency of each letter in the ransom note for Bayes.

A:

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd


# Load the 'ransom.csv' into a DataFrame
r = pd.read_csv('ransom.csv')


# Display DataFrame
print(r)


Ex01:


Q:

Correct the code so that it runs without syntax errors


A:

# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors

# Plot a graph
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)

# Display the graph
plt.show()

Ex02:

Q:

Create a variable called plate that represents the observed license plate:

the first three letters were FRQ, but the witness couldn't see the final 4

letters. Use asterisks (*) to represent missing letters.


A:

# Define plate to represent a plate beginning with FRQ
# Use * to represent the missing four letters
plate = 'FRQ****'


Ex03:


Q:

Call lookup_plate() using the variable plate.


A:

# Call the function lookup_plate()
lookup_plate(plate)


Ex04:


Q:

Calling lookup_plate() with the license plate FRQ**** produced too many results.

Luckily, lookup_plate() also accepts a keyword argument: color. Use the color of
the car ('Green') to get a smaller list.


A:

# Call lookup_plate() with the keyword argument for color
lookup_plate(plate, color='Green')

- [ ] What is pandas?

Ex00:


Q:
Import the pandas module under the alias pd.

Load the CSV "credit_records.csv" into a DataFrame called credit_records.

Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method.


A:
# Import pandas under the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV "credit_records.csv"
credit_records = pd.read_csv('credit_records.csv')

# Display the first five rows of credit_records using the .head() method
print(credit_records.head())

Ex01:

Q:
Use the .info() method to inspect the DataFrame credit_records

A:
# Use .info() to inspect the DataFrame credit_records
print(credit_records.info())

How many rows are in credit_records?

103

104 - CORRECT

5

64


---
- [ ] Selecting columns

Ex00:

Q:

Select the column item from credit_records using brackets and string notation.

Select the column item from credit_records using dot notation.


A:
# Select the column item from credit_records
# Use brackets and string notation
items = credit_records['item']

items = credit_records.item


# Display the results
print(items)


Ex01:


Q:

Correct the code so that it runs without errors.


A:
# One or more lines of code contain errors.
# Fix the errors so that the code runs.

# Select the location column in credit_records
location = credit_records['location']

# Select the item column in credit_records
items = credit_records.item

# Display results
print(location)

Ex02:

Q:

Inspect the DataFrame mpr using info()

A:
# Use info() to inspect mpr
print(mpr.info())

Q:

Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without errors.

A:

# The following code contains one or more errors
# Correct the mistakes in the code so that it runs without errors

# Select column "Dog Name" from mpr
name = mpr['Dog Name']

# Select column "Missing?" from mpr
is_missing = mpr['Missing?']

# Display the columns
print(name)

print(is_missing)


Q:

Why did this code generate an error?

name = mpr.Dog Name


A:

We need to remove the space in Dog Name.

If a column name has capital letters, then it needs to be in brackets and
string notation. - WRONG. Capital letters can use this type of notation

If a column name contains a space, then it needs to be in brackets and string
notation. - CORRECT


---
- [ ] Selecting rows with logic

Ex00:

Q:
The variable height_inches represents the height of a suspect. Is height_inches
greater than 70 inches?


The variable plate1 represents a license plate number of a suspect. Is it equal
to FRQ123?


The variable fur_color represents the color of Bayes' fur. Check that fur_color
is not equal to "brown".



A:
# Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?
print(height_inches > 70)
# Is plate1 equal to "FRQ123"?
print(plate1 == "FRQ123")
# Is fur_color not equal to "brown"?
print(fur_color != "brown")

Ex01:

A:

Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2.

Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing.

Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle.


Q:
# Select the dogs where Age is greater than 2
greater_than_2 = mpr[mpr.Age > 2]

print(greater_than_2)


# Select the dogs whose Status is equal to Still Missing
still_missing = mpr[mpr.Status == 'Still Missing']

print(still_missing)


# Select all dogs whose Dog Breed is not equal to Poodle
not_poodle = mpr[mpr['Dog Breed'] != 'Poodle']

print(not_poodle)


Ex02:


Q:

Select rows of credit_records such that the column location is equal to 'Pet
Paradise'.


A:
# Select purchases from 'Pet Paradise'
purchase = credit_records[credit_records.location == 'Pet Paradise']

# Display
print(purchase)

Q:
Which suspects purchased pet supplies before the kidnapping?

A:
Fred Frequentist and Ronald Aylmer Fisher

Gertrude Cox and Kirstine Smith

Fred Frequentist and Gertrude Cox - CORRECT

Ronald Aylmer Fisher and Kirstine Smith
